# windows-ai-agent-toolset-v4
A lot of improvements, repository cleanup, auto parser of lm studio server logs - thats useful a lot, the message exchange during agentic work contains 2 images current and previous one - the reson is obvious why, so, this is also a huge thing, then small improvements in the workflow, there were incorrect ids of messages and also added the as chatgpt said “cheap fingerprint” you wanted for debugging mechanism (to make sure that two identical images will be noticed if sent in logs which was happening earlier due to id problems,incosistencies - a lot of work a result - 2b model does its job as we may expect from 2b one, there is need to create very specialized test scenarios to make it behave optimal way and also spot any problems, but its worth to run the sytem on larger model - it should do some real work now - a good release - manual labor this time with assistance of ai but mainly manual - gives a lot better results than just throwing to ai "fix this" fix that" without looking at the output even - good lesson - PROFIT
